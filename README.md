Tarik is a location-based guessing game. It is dependent of the longitude and latitude of a user’s location to generate a historical quiz based on nearby tourist site.

## Basics

`<View>` is a container that behaves similar to a `<div>` element on web, but
renders to a `UIView`.  `<Text>`, `<Image>`, and `<ScrollView>` are other basic
components and there are several more.  You can compose these elements into
component trees just like normal react or HTML elements, and they can be styled
with the `style` property, which supports a subset of flexbox layout.  

Native events come in as you would expect via `onChange`, `onScroll`, `onTouch`
and other props. `TouchableHighlight` makes it really easy to build nice buttons
via `onPress`, which plays nicely with scroll views and other interactions via
the responder system.
