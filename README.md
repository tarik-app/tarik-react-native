Tarik is a location-based guessing game. It is dependent of the longitude and latitude of a user’s location to generate a historical quiz based on nearby tourist site. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Project Status

This project is still not fully done. More iterations and features coming up...

### Prerequisites

- React Native
- JavaScript knowledge
- [Download Expo](https://expo.io/) app on your phone to run the app simulation on your phone


### Installing

> To get started...


- **Option 1**
    - 🍴 Fork this repo!

- **Option 2**
    - 👯 Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/tarik-app/tarik-react-native.git`

### Quick Start

Get up and running with Tarik sample app:

1. Once you have the repo cloned and met all the requirements above, start the
packager that will transform your JS code on-the-fly:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Basics

`<View>` is a container that behaves similar to a `<div>` element on web, but
renders to a `UIView`.  `<Text>`, `<Image>`, and `<ScrollView>` are other basic
components and there are several more.  You can compose these elements into
component trees just like normal react or HTML elements, and they can be styled
with the `style` property, which supports a subset of flexbox layout.  

Native events come in as you would expect via `onChange`, `onScroll`, `onTouch`
and other props. `TouchableHighlight` makes it really easy to build nice buttons
via `onPress`, which plays nicely with scroll views and other interactions via
the responder system.
